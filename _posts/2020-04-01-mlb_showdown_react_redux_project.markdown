I've always been a huge baseball fan, and with this season's start being delayed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, I'm missing baseball more than ever. Because of this, I decided to build something baseball related for my React/Redux portfolio project.

As a kid, my friends and I would play this MLB strategy card game, MLB Showdown. I was able to find csv files containing the baseball card data, so I decided I would build an app that would replicate playing the card game.

My project consists of a Rails API backend, and a frontend built using React and Redux. A user is able to search thru hundreds of player cards and select the ones that they want to build out their new lineup or deck.

In the future, I will add functionality to this project to actually be able to play the game using simulations.

This project was pretty hard for me, but now that I finished it, I feel super accomplished and ready to graduate Flatiron School.

It's amazing how far my cohort has come, from the first labs just putting "Hello, World" on the CLI to now building full size applications utilizing multiple coding languages and concepts.
