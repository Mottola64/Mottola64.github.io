For my JavaScript project, I built an application called BookTracker. I've noticed that sometimes when I am having a conversation with a friend about reading and specifically which books I'd recommend to them, I sometimes have a hard time remembering the book.  Even if I remember a book I've read, it can be hard to remember what you thought of the book if you hadn't written down notes on it or kept track. This was the basis of the application which allows users to add books that they've read and add reviews to the books once they are added to their list.
​
In the future I plan on adding a user model where different users can log in to the application and view their own list of books, or view the books that their friends have read. They could then write reviews on their friends books or add books that their friends have read to a list of books that they'd like to read.
​
This application was created using a Ruby on Rails API Backend and a JavaScript Frontend. The JavaScript Frontend utilizes two classes, BooksAdapter & ReviewsAdapter, and these classes communicate with the Backend to send data to the server. Inside these classes I set up several fetch requests to get information from the database.
​
There are several improvements to be made to this application in the future, including the user model and better styling with CSS, but for now it functions as a book tracker for reading enthusiasts.
